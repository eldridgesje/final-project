### <a name="factors"></a>**The Five Factors**

The most popular and well-validated model of personality in social science is the Five-Factor model, also known as the "Big Five" or "OCEAN" model. This model was developed through [factor analysis](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/factor-analysis/) of thousands of words used to describe people's personalities. This analysis indicated that descriptors of personality seem to be related to five broad factors.  
<br>
**Openness:** An individual's openness to new experiences, linked to being curious, creative, and spontaneous. People with low Openness scores tend to be more routine-driven, practical, or closed-minded.   
<br>
**Conscientiousness:** An individual's inclination toward dutifulness and reliability, linked to being organized and reliable. People with low Conscientiousness scores tend to be more messy, inpulsive, or careless.    
<br>
**Extraversion:** An individual's level of sociability, linked to being outgoing and fun-loving. People with low Extraversion tend to be reserved, shy, or thoughtful.  
<br>
**Agreeableness:** An individual's tendency toward getting along with others, linked to being helpful, trusting, or modest. Indviduals with low Agreeableness tend to be stubborn, argumentative, or suspicious.   
<br>
**Neuroticism:**  Sometimes defined by its opposite, "emotional stability", this is an individual's tendency toward extremes of emotion, linked to anxiety, irritability, and insecurity. People with low Neuroticism tend to be more calm, steady, or resilient.  

It's important to note that each of these factors is a scale, often scored from 0 to 100, and every individual whose personality is analyzed in this way will be given a score in each category. Five-factor analysis does not categorize people's personalities, it describes them.

### <a name="cluster"></a>**Cluster analysis**

[Cluster analysis](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/cluster-analysis/) is the task of grouping items in a data set such that items in each group are more similar to each other than they are to the items in the other groups. There are a variety of statistical methods to perform these groupings, but the one most relevant to our work is **k-means analysis**.
