          <h2>OCEAN Model</h2>
          </p>
            <p>
               <br>The most popular and well-validated model of personality in social science is the Five-Factor model, 
                also known as the "Big Five" or "OCEAN" model. This model was developed through <a href="https://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/factor-analysis/" class="mw-redirect" title="factor analysis">factor analysisy</a>, 
                of thousands of words used to describe people's personalities. 
                This analysis indicated that descriptors of personality seem to be related to five broad factors. These categories were validated in the 1990s as a scientifically backed way to evaluate a person’s character. 
                It's important to note that each of these factors is a scale, often scored from 0 to 100, and every individual whose personality is analyzed in this way will be given a score in each category. 
                Five-factor analysis does not categorize people's personalities, it describes them.                
                <br><br>The combination of where you fall on the spectrum of the five traits provides a window into your general disposition and potentially your future behavior. 
                Different combinations of trait scores could indicate aptitude for a particular kind of job, the strength of interpersonal relationships and even the likelihood of 
                developing psychological, physical health issues, or political behaviors., <br><br><a href="https://clefevre.moonfruit.com/home/4562134246" class="mw-redirect" title="Carmen Lefevre">Carmen Lefevre</a>
                a research associate at the University College of London, focuses on the biological motives of facial structure 
                (facial width-to-height ratio linked to level of testosterone production and correlated with passive/dominant characteristics) and skin color and how they play a major role in our personality and behavioral traits.

                <br><br><h2>How our chemistry affects our behavior:</h2>
                <br>People high in extraversion have been found to carry long forms of the gene DRD4 linked to dopamine production. Those who carry DRD4 have more dopamine production when they have a positive experience.
                <br><br>People high in conscientiousness have been found to have more volume in the middle frontal gyrus in the left lateral pre-frontal cortex part of the brain. This is where we plan for the future and make decisions.
                <br><br>People high in agreeableness have been found to have less volume in the orbitofrontal lobe of their brain—this is where we process emotions and make decisions. One study also found that people who are highly agreeable have an easier time predicting the mental states of others.
                <br><br>People high in neuroticism have been found to carry long forms of the Serotonin Transport Gene producing serotonin to calm us down.  High neurotics produce serotonin more slowly, so they have a harder time regulating their emotions after a negative event.
                <br><br><h2>Five Personality Descriptions:</h2>

                <br><h2>Openness:</h2> An individual's openness to new experiences, linked to being curious, creative, and spontaneous. People with low Openness scores tend to be more routine-driven, practical, or closed-minded.
                <br><br>Sample Items
                <ul>
                  <li>I love adventure.</li>
                  <li>I am imaginative.</li>
                  <li>I am the first to try new activities.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>Agree - high in openness
                <br>Disagree - low in openness

                <br><h3>Openness has 57% genetic influence</h3>

                <br><br> <a href="https://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481(12)60607-1/fulltext" class="mw-redirect" title="longevity">openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion are linked to longevity</a>
                

                <br><h2>Conscientiousness:</h2>An individual's inclination toward dutifulness and reliability, linked to being organized, goal directed behaviors, good impulse control, and high levels of thoughtfulness. 
             
                <br><br>People with low Conscientiousness scores tend to be more messy, impulsive, or careless.

                <br><br><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614561800" class="mw-redirect" title="A 75-yearlongitudinal study">A 75-yearlongitudinal study</a>
               determined that men with conscientious personality traits have been known to live longer.

                
                <br><br>Sample Items
<ul>
  <li>I am highly self-disciplined.</li>
  <li>I am very organized and always come prepared.</li>
  <li>I like to know the plan rather than be spontaneous.</li>
</ul>
<br>Agree - high in conscientiousness
<br>Disagree - low in conscientiousness
<br><h3>Conscientiousness has 49% genetic influence</h3>
<br><br><h2>Extraversion:</h2> An individual's level of sociability, linked to being outgoing and fun-loving. People with low Extraversion tend to be reserved, solitary, or thoughtful.
<br><br>Sample Items
<ul>
  <li>I am the life of the party.</li>
  <li>I don’t mind being the center of attention.</li>
  <li>I am usually the one to start a conversation with someone.</li>
</ul>
<br>Agree - high in extroversion
<br>Disagree - low in extroversion
<br><h3>Extraversion has 54% genetic influence</h3>
<br><br>People who are more outgoing and sociable have the strongest immune system, compared to those who are more introspective and introverted.
<br><br>This
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453014004168" class="mw-redirect" title="study">study</a>
 proves that the bodies of extroverted people are primed to have stronger immune systems since they are more exposed to germs or sickness as they interact with more people on a regular basis.



 <br><br>This <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-introverted-face/381697/" class="mw-redirect" title="study">study</a>
 also found that we judge someone’s level of extroversion or introversion immediately–often based on facial structure.


<br><br><h2>Agreeableness:</h2> An individual's tendency toward getting along with others, linked to being friendly, optimistic, compassionate, trusting, or modest. Individuals with low Agreeableness tend to be stubborn, argumentative, or suspicious.

<br><br>Sample Items
<ul>
  <li>I tend to trust people and give them the benefit of the doubt.</li>
  <li>I am extremely empathetic.</li>
  <li>I like to make other people feel at ease.</li>
</ul>
<br>Agree - high in agreeableness
<br>Disagree - low in agreeableness
<br><h3>Agreeableness has 42% genetic influence</h3>
<br><br><a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/psp/hbpr/2015/00000002/00000001/art00006?token=005d1c8d06b44ff9bfd27b76504c48662a252e235b467b31636f386a332b257d7241255e4e6b633121bf32db99a86" class="mw-redirect" title="Research">Research</a>
has shown that people high in agreeableness and optimism have healthier hearts than those who are pessimistic or neurotic.
<br><br><h2>Neuroticism:</h2> Sometimes defined by its opposite, "emotional stability", this is an individual's tendency toward extremes of emotion, linked to anxiety, irritability, and insecurity. People with low Neuroticism tend to be more calm, steady, or resilient.
<br><br>Sample Items
<ul>
  <li>I stress out easily.</li>
  <li>I tend to be moody.</li>
  <li>I am a worrier.</li>
</ul>
<br>Agree - high in neuroticism
<br>Disagree - low in neuroticism
<br><h3>Neuroticism has 48% genetic influence</h3>
